# Wordplan / English Dictionary

Welcome to this project, I've been working on it to create an English Dictionary easy and functional. I study English and Web Development every day, and creating this project I was able to improve these two skills.

To run it follow the following steps:

# 1) download or clone this repo
# 2) copy this to your console: npm install
# 3) run the project with: npm run dev

# Any comments, tips and more will be well received! Feel free to contribute ü§ù
